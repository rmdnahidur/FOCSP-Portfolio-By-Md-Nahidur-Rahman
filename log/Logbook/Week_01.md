# Week 1 – Summary Notes
**Level 4 – Semester 1 – BSc (Hons) Computing (Leeds Beckett University)**
**Fundamentals of Computer Programming**

## 1. What is a Computer Program?

A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.  
Every program follows the sequence:

**Input → Processing → Output**

- **Input**: Data provided to the program (keyboard, file, mouse, etc.)  
- **Processing**: The program works on the data  
- **Output**: The result shown to the user (screen, file, etc.)

Programs are written by **programmers** using **programming languages** that computers can understand.

## 2. Why Do We Use Programming Languages?

Computers only understand **machine code** (numbers).  
Programming languages let humans write instructions in a readable way.  
These instructions are then translated into machine code for the computer to run.

## 3. Generations of Programming Languages

### 1GL – First Generation
- Machine code (numbers only)  
- Very difficult to write and understand  
- Different for each type of computer

### 2GL – Second Generation
- **Assembly language**  
- Uses short words (mnemonics) instead of numbers  
- Still CPU-specific  
- Converted using an **Assembler**

### 3GL – Third Generation
- Most modern languages: **C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript**  
- Easier to read and write  
- Translated using a **Compiler** or **Interpreter**  
- Python is a 3GL language

### 4GL – Fourth Generation
- More human-friendly  
- Focuses on *what* to do rather than *how* to do it  
- Examples: **SQL, R, SPSS**  
- Often used for data analysis or specialized tasks

## 4. Python Programming Language

Python is:

- Easy to learn  
- Widely used in industry and education  
- Supports **procedural**, **functional**, and **object-oriented** programming  

**Common Applications:**
- Artificial Intelligence  
- Data Science  
- Cyber Security  
- Digital Forensics  

Python is an excellent first programming language for beginners.

## 5. Python Interpreter and IDE

### Python Interpreter
- Works in **interactive mode**  
- Uses **REPL**:
  - **Read** → Read the code  
  - **Evaluate** → Process the code  
  - **Print** → Show the result  
  - **Loop** → Repeat  
- Lets you type code and see results immediately  

Example:
```python
>>> 10 + 5
15
