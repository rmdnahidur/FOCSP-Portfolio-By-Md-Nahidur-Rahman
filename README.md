# FOCPP – Foundation of Computing Programming

## Overview

This repository presents my academic work completed for the **Foundation of Computing Programming (FOCPP)** module. It documents my learning journey in basic computing principles and Python programming through weekly practical activities, structured notebooks, and a final Python project. The repository is intended to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and my ability to apply them in a structured and logical manner.

All materials included here were produced as part of my university coursework. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used strictly as a **supportive learning resource**, comparable to consulting tutorials or textbooks. Every piece of code was reviewed, tested, and fully understood by me before inclusion.

## Repository Organisation

The repository follows a clear and logical folder structure to ensure ease of navigation and assessment.

### Weekly Assignments

The **By_weekly_assignment** folder contains the programming tasks completed on a weekly basis throughout the module. Each file reflects the work undertaken in a specific teaching week and focuses on building foundational Python skills gradually. The exercises emphasise understanding and correct application rather than advanced complexity. Topics covered across these tasks include variables and data types, input and output operations, conditional statements, loops, functions, and basic problem-solving techniques using Python.

### Jupyter Notebooks

The **Noteboook** folder contains Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files used during laboratory and practice sessions. These notebooks show step-by-step code execution, supported by comments and explanations that reflect my learning process. They demonstrate logical thinking, experimentation, debugging, and the development of clean and readable code, highlighting how programming concepts were learned progressively.

### Project Work

The **Project** folder holds the main Python project developed for this module. This project integrates multiple programming concepts into a complete, functional program that can be executed from the command line. It incorporates structured functions, user input handling, and file operations where appropriate. Additional supporting documents such as a `README.md`, dependency files, and design explanations are included to clearly describe the project’s purpose and functionality in line with assessment requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

This repository demonstrates my achievement of key learning outcomes, including a sound understanding of introductory computing and programming concepts, the ability to write clear and functional Python programs, effective problem-solving using logical structures, appropriate use of comments and documentation, and basic proficiency in using GitHub for organising and managing coursework.

## How to Navigate the Repository

Reviewers are encouraged to begin with the weekly assignment folder to observe consistent progress over time, examine the Jupyter notebooks for detailed practice and explanation, and explore the project folder to see how individual concepts are combined into a complete program. The AI declaration file should be read to understand how academic integrity has been maintained.

## Academic Integrity Statement

I confirm that all work contained in this repository represents my own learning and academic effort. Artificial Intelligence tools were used solely to support understanding and were not used as a substitute for independent work or critical thinking.
