## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In this module, I used Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to support my learning and to deepen my understanding of Python programming concepts.

The AI tools were mainly used for:

Gaining a clear understanding of key Python concepts, including variables, conditional statements, loops, and functions

Viewing simple and easy-to-follow Python code examples for learning and reference

Understanding programming errors and why they happen

Learning to write code that is clean, readable, and well-commented

Generating ideas on how to organize programs, projects, and my programming portfolio

All the code in this portfolio was carefully reviewed, tested, and fully understood by me. I did not copy any AI-generated code blindly. Instead, I adapted it where needed, tested it thoroughly, and added my own comments and explanations to show my understanding.

AI tools were used solely as a learning aid, similar to consulting a tutor, reading a reference book, or using official documentation. Their use helped me improve my understanding of Python programming as well as related areas such as cybersecurity and computing.

I confirm that this portfolio reflects my own effort and learning, and that AI was used only as a supportive educational resource, in full compliance with academic integrity standards.
